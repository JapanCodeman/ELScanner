create adminStudentProfile for viewing students in a class (add Update/Delete functionality to these)

Add password reset feature (on login if !user.password, redirect to "set password" page) - add this to student-profile as red button - delete user's password on backend

.pop() on .env one time use codes for admin registration

page for admin to CRUD classes

Fix backend to not output user information to non JWT holders (and not just random JWT)

Student profile page spits back to rescan scan-student-id on refresh...? Only ready solution is to store in sessionStorage?

bugs:

  critical - scanner.js not stopping scanning on "back"/navigating to new page - only stops on changing page and refresh or correctly reading a code

NOTES ON REAL TRIAL:

  Student registration - multiple clicks resulted in students creating multiple MULTIPLE accounts - possible solutions:
    one time use codes similar to administrator (may result in students submitting multiple registrations with the same OTUC)

    disable "register" button onClick (effectively disable user's ability to fire register function while api call is being made)

  Books must be registered before checking out
    Due to an issue in routing?

    input - "check book out to {student}" => navigate('/scan-book-id') => UPC read and callback; not found in database => navigate('/register-new-book') => fill information; register click

    expected output - window.alert('${book} checked out to ${student}); navigate('/admin-home')

    actual output - stays on register page; registers book; no checkout

  Make select drop downs for publisher/author - tedious when registering many books - register publishers component? authors component?

  @jwt_required() currently blocking routes completely; how to configure?
