fix failed promise return on incorrect password on login (this will probably be resolved along with figuring out how to return a different response for fresh tokens)

refactor server responses to all caps in snake case

CLASS RESET FOR STUDENTS (admin administer a class reset to all students at the end of the year; students get one chance to set their class; admins can confirm this later by looking at the 'new' classes) - not functioning

need to find a way to return response for users without a class and still issue them a token so they can navigate to the classReset page while maintaining identity - this may only be necessary for end of year class changes.

Not good to mutate config vars for one time use codes - find a different method or set "request admin promotion function"? (not really necessary - just good coding practice)

Student profile page spits back to rescan scan-student-id on refresh...? Only ready solution is to store in localStorage?

shift handling of "no delete last admin" to front end to handle better

Checking book back in from studentProfile.js properly works, but:
  Maybe redirect back to viewStudents.js? (would be useful in reading class for checking many books in quickly)

NOTES ON REAL TRIAL:

  Make select drop downs for publisher/author - tedious when registering many books - register publishers component? authors component?
