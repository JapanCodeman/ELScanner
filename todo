fix failed promise return on incorrect password on login

refactor server responses to all caps in snake case

need to find a way to return response for users without a class and still issue them a token so they can navigate to the classReset page while maintaining identity

.pop() on .env one time use codes for admin registration - NOT WORKING; currently unable to register administrators from web

Fix backend to not output user information to non JWT holders (and not just random JWT)

Student profile page spits back to rescan scan-student-id on refresh...? Only ready solution is to store in localStorage?

delete student function in studentProfile.js needs a warning before execution

add ability to view other admins to be able to reset their passwords for them or delete their accounts - user cannot delete themselves so one administrator; add safeguard that checks how many returns for users.find({admin search}). If this value == 1, delete request denied 

Checking book back in from studentProfile.js properly works, but:
  Maybe redirect back to viewStudents.js? (would be useful in reading class for checking many books in quickly)

NOTES ON REAL TRIAL:

  Make select drop downs for publisher/author - tedious when registering many books - register publishers component? authors component?

  @jwt_required() currently blocking routes completely; how to configure?
