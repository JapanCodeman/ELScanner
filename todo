create adminStudentProfile for viewing students in a class (add Update/Delete functionality to these)

.pop() on .env one time use codes for admin registration - NOT WORKING; currently unable to register administrators from web

page for admin to CRUD classes

Fix backend to not output user information to non JWT holders (and not just random JWT)

Student profile page spits back to rescan scan-student-id on refresh...? Only ready solution is to store in sessionStorage?

delete student function in studentProfile.js needs a warning before execution

Checking book back in from studentProfile.js properly works, but:
  Maybe redirect back to viewStudents.js? (would be useful in reading class for checking many books in quickly)

  window.alert displays "undefined returned..." instead of the proper book title

bugs:

  critical - scanner.js not stopping scanning on "back"/navigating to new page - only stops on changing page and refresh or correctly reading a code

NOTES ON REAL TRIAL:

  Books must be registered before checking out
    Due to an issue in routing?

    input - "check book out to {student}" => navigate('/scan-book-id') => UPC read and callback; not found in database => navigate('/register-new-book') => fill information; register click

    expected output - window.alert('${book} checked out to ${student}); navigate('/admin-home')

    actual output - stays on register page; registers book; no checkout

  Make select drop downs for publisher/author - tedious when registering many books - register publishers component? authors component?

  @jwt_required() currently blocking routes completely; how to configure?
