create adminStudentProfile for viewing students in a class (add Update/Delete functionality to these)

.pop() on .env one time use codes for admin registration - NOT WORKING; currently unable to register administrators from web

page for admin to CRUD classes

Fix backend to not output user information to non JWT holders (and not just random JWT)

Student profile page spits back to rescan scan-student-id on refresh...? Only ready solution is to store in localStorage?

delete student function in studentProfile.js needs a warning before execution

add ability to view other admins to be able to reset their passwords for them or delete their accounts - user cannot delete themselves so one administrator; add safeguard that checks how many returns for users.find({admin search}). If this value == 1, delete request denied 

Ended up with MANY duplicates of a single book somehow? (The Blue eye)

Checking book back in from studentProfile.js properly works, but:
  Maybe redirect back to viewStudents.js? (would be useful in reading class for checking many books in quickly)

bugs:

  critical - scanner.js not stopping scanning on "back"/navigating to new page - only stops on changing page and refresh or correctly reading a code

NOTES ON REAL TRIAL:

  Make select drop downs for publisher/author - tedious when registering many books - register publishers component? authors component?

  @jwt_required() currently blocking routes completely; how to configure?
