incorporate chart.js to admin options

create adminStudentProfile for viewing students in a class (add Update/Delete functionality to these)

Add password reset feature (on login if !user.password, redirect to "set password" page) - add this to student-profile as red button - delete user's password on backend

.pop() on .env one time use codes for admin registration

page for admin to CRUD classes

Fix backend to not output user information to non JWT holders (and not just random JWT)

Student profile page spits back to rescan scan-student-id on refresh...? Only ready solution is to store in sessionStorage?

Students' listOfReadBooks should only update for unique books read - use "if UPC in student["listOfReadBooks"] approach 

bugs:

  critical - scanner.js not stopping scanning on "back"/navigating to new page - only stops on changing page and refresh or correctly reading a code
